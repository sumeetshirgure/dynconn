# Dynamic circuit compilation for sparse qubit connectivity
This repository contains code written as part of a project demonstrating
compilation of dynamic quantum circuits to improve on the connectivity requirements
of a given quantum circuit.
This work is based on the paper titled AC/DC [1].

A poster presentation corresponding to this work was accepted at the
IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE25) (2025)
that has been attached in this repository.
